# StartPython

These are the steps I usually found myself in when I try to help newcomers in Python

There are many different programming levels at which you could join, every directory is a subset of what is needed before jumping to the next one

1. [First steps](/1.first_steps): Installation, first contact, variables, functions, loops and conditions overview.
2. [Scripts](/2.scripts): How to create and run a script.
3. [Modules](/3.modules): Having multiple files in python.
4. [Classes](/4.classes): Object Oriented Python: what are objects, classes, inheritance.
