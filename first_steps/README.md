# First steps

Welcome!

You're going to write your first lines of Python. But first we need to check everything is right!

1. Check you have Python installed:
  - type python in a terminal, it should say something like this:
```
$> python
Python 2.7.6 (default, Mar 22 2014, 22:59:56) 
[GCC 4.8.2] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> 
```
    if not you need to install python. You will find everything you need on Google :)

2. (optional) Install some tools which are going to make your life easier:
  - [ipython](http://ipython.org/) is an improved command line interface. You can use it in a browser.
  - [pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip) is a package manager. It installs dependencies, librairies, ...
  - [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) is useful if you have different python projects and you want them to have their own dependencies.
