# First steps

Welcome!


## Initial setup
You're going to write your first lines of Python. But first we need to check everything is right!

1. Check you have Python installed:
  - type python in a terminal, it should say something like this:
```
$> python
Python 2.7.6 (default, Mar 22 2014, 22:59:56) 
[GCC 4.8.2] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> 
```
if not you need to install python. You will find everything you need on Google :) (or you can go to [installation](#installation)
HINT: if you're lazy you can even use the provided notebook (ipython) to play around ;)

2. (optional) Install some tools which are going to make your life easier:
  - [pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip) is a package manager. It installs dependencies, librairies, ...
  - [ipython](http://ipython.org/) is an improved command line interface. You can use it in a browser.
  - [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) is useful if you have different python projects and you want them to have their own dependencies.


## First program

A easy way to start coding in python is by using a command line interface (CLI). It's what you get when you type "python" or "ipython".
You could write your entire program in the CLI, but I promise you you don't want to do this ;) !

Still, it's easy to start with the CLI because you can write code and immediately see what happens. And in this course you won't even need python on your computer since there is a notebook already available on GitHub for you to play with! Have a look.


## Installation

(if you did not have Python installed)

Go to [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and choose a version which suits your needs.
There is even a [Beginners Page](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download) !
